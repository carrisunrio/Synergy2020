# Synergy2020

Synergy is the Official Sports Club of IGDTUW. We at Synergy believe in inculcating
the spirit of sports among women. Our teams have also participated and won many laurels in various
inter college sports meets. Synergy conducts intra-college tournaments of volleyball, cricket,
badminton and many more sports. We also regularly conduct events and sports challenges in the 
university, mainly to involve more and more women and give them the push they need to pursue sports
and overcome the hesitation and stigma that is often associated with female participation in sports.
